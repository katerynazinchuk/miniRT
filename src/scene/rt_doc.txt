 when light hits the spot ofr can be connected with the sourse of light only then we use property - colour
 so on the beggining we create an object with all nessesary properties and only that, give permision to use some
closer the light - brighter the color. and oposite
for each pixel,
	color c;
	for each shape in the scene
		send a ray through each pixel and see if it collides with a shape
		if it does
			color = calculate color of ray
		else, color = background color
	return color

To calculate color of ray...
	color c = 0,0,0 // rgb
	for each light source in the scene
		make a new ray (shad_ray) that starts at where the original ray hit the shape...
		... and ends at the light source
		see if the shadow ray hits a shape on its way to the light
		if it does, 
			calculate ambient color using ambient color of shape material and...
			... ambient light intensity 
		if not,
			calculate shading with sum of ambient/diffuse/specular components 

cast many rays per pixel and combine all colors into one, to gt smoother blending of colors = super-sampling
can impement it with thread multitasking
