ε to the rescue ...
• Check if t is within some epsilon tolerance:
– if abs(µ) < ε
• point is on the surface
– else
• point is inside/outside
– Choose the ε tolerance empirically
• Move the intersection point by epsilon along the surface
normal so it is outside of the object
• Check if point is inside/outside surface by checking the
sign of the implicit (sphere etc.) equation
